# EDA-Habermans-Cancer-Survival-Dataset

The repository consists of a ipynb for EDA on Habermans Cancer Survival Dataset. various EDA techniques are used to determine the outcome and conclusion from the dataset. Data Description The Haberman's survival dataset contains cases from a study that was conducted between 1958 and 1970 at the University of Chicago's Billings Hospital on the survival of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

Attribute Information:

  1. Age of patient at time of operation (numerical)
  2. Patient's year of operation (year - 1900, numerical)
  3. Number of positive axillary nodes detected (numerical)
  4. Survival status (class attribute) 1 = the patient survived 5 years or longer 2 = the patient died within 5 years

Objective :

To predict whether the patient will survive after 5 years or not based upon the patient's age, year of treatment and the number of positive lymph nodes
